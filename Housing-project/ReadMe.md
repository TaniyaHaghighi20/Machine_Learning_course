The layout
is as follows:
• Linear Regression.ipynb: Implements data loading,
PR1-style preprocessing, and training for ordinary least
squares linear regression on the housing data.
• Polynomial Regression.ipynb: Extends the linear model
with polynomial feature generation and grid search over
degree and scaling options, using the same preprocessed
features.
• Neural Network Regression.ipynb: Trains an MLP re gressor on
standardized features and target.
• PR1.ipynb: Reproduction of Li’s (link to paper in the ipynb) Random Forest and
XGBoost pipeline including feature importance anal-
ysis and detailed metrics.
• PR2.ipynb: Adaptation of Fu’s comparative study of
linear regression and Random Forest (link to paper in the ipynb) to the housing
dataset, using the same PR1 preprocessing.
